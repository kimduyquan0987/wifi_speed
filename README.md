## Build using GitHub Actions

If you don't want to build locally, push this repository to GitHub and run the `Build Windows EXE` workflow (or wait for it to run on push to `main`). The workflow will produce a `wifi_speed_windows_exe` artifact containing the `wifi_speed.exe` file.

Steps:

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push all files in this package.
2. On GitHub, open the Actions tab and run the `Build Windows EXE` workflow (or push to `main`).
3. Download the artifact from the workflow run.
